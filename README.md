# Optimization_of_Multi-Flow_Nozzle
This project is done as a part of an ongoing research study where we develop an empirical equation of nozzle parameters by Multivariate Polynomial Regression.
In file "Optimizatuin_MultiFlowNozzle.ipynb", Red points in the 3-dimensional graph are predicted values and the Green points are the corresponding actual values 
"Nozzle-Data" was experimentally collected
